# StarWarsDialog

This is a really quick ASP.NET Core API app that will return lines of dialog from the original Star Wars screenplay. I wanted a small app that I can practice deployment options: 

- Virtual Machines, Windows or Linux
- API app
- Simple container
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD with webhooks, etc
- Azure Functions

To Do:
- Upgrade to VS 2022
- Make container image
